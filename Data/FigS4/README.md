Data for Fig.S4 in the supplemental material.

1st column stands for r0, 2nd stands for r1, 3rd stands for the real part of the correlation function, 4th is the real part, 5th is the distance r1-r0

Fig. S4(a) plots Sz=0 triplet pairing correlation along a-bond at different bond dimension M. Files start with Ptud_aa

Fig. S4(b) plots reduced density-density correlation: D(r0,r1)-Ne(r0)*Ne(r1)
